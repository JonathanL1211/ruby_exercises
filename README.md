# 1. Authentication Exercise
This exercise requires the user to make an authentication system where the user inputs the username and password, in return the system would give back the data in the array of hashes. If the attempts to find the data exceed 4 times, the system would exit and shutdown. :innocent:

Run:
```
authentication.rb
```
